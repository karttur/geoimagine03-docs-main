## Introduction

A local clone or copy of a PyDev project can be imported to <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> either as a complete project, or by building a backbone PyDev project and copying and pasting selected parts.

The original version of this post was written for the [first version of Karttur's GeoImagine Framework](https://karttur.github.io/geoimagine/putinplace/putinplace-import-project-eclipse/), with the online repo including the <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> PyDev project. Later versions of the Framework are kept as super-project repos without the <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> project files.

With the PyDev project files removed from the online repo, it is no longer possible to import a prepared <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> project. You must instead follow the instructions for [Copy and paste Karttur's GeoImagine Framework](../putinplace-copy-project-eclipse/).

Another alternative is to clone the Framework directly into <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> from the repo on Karttur's GitHub pages as described in the post on [Git clone with Eclipse and no project](../putinplace-clone-eclipse-no-proj/).
